===============

Use Chrome? Copy link address without right-clicking! Just use your standard keyboard shortcut!

If you need to copy link addresses more than once, you know how annoying it is.
You need to right-click, find the "Copy Link Address" menu item, and click it.

This extension makes your life easy. Just point to your link and hit your standard keyboard shortcut
(Ctrl-C, or Cmd-C for Mac) and you're done!
