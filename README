copylinkaddress
===============

Use Chrome? Copy link address without right-clicking! Just use your standard keyboard shortcut!
----

If you need to copy link addresses more than once, you know how annoying it is.
You need to right-click, find the "Copy Link Address" menu item, and click it.

This extension makes your life easy. Just point to your link and hit your standard keyboard shortcut
(Ctrl-C, or Cmd-C for Mac) and you're done!

To try the extension,

1. Download the source (hit the 'ZIP' button you see at the top of the page) and extract to a directory
2. In Chrome, launch chrome://extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click 'Load Unpacked Extensions' and point to the above directory.
5. Start using it!


Note:
----

The extension doesn't accurately work with dynamically generated links as of now.
Please stick to using it with static links (i.e. ones created at page load).
